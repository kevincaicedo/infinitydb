# M4 gate-run report

date: 1786697423 (unix) · cells: 4 · conns: 8 · pipeline: 8 · duration: 600s · dataset: 10× budget · ycsb rows: 2 (M4-S22)
env-check: OK
tier: dev (non-binding)

notes:
- harness: inf-bench ycsb — memtier cannot drive a 10× RAM zipfian tier workload (§6)
- E-adaptation: cursor-scan slices (SCAN <cursor> COUNT 1..=100, pipeline 1) — the keyspace is unordered, no ordered range-scan exists (documented deviation)
- value shape: single constant-byte value of --value-size (default 1 KiB ≈ YCSB's 10×100 B fields); D's `latest` uses a per-connection frontier estimate
- dataset: 20971520 keys × 1024 B = 20480 MiB = 10× the 2048 MiB memory budget · seed 0xbb3781d7 · θ 0.99
- mode: TIERED — the D8 refusal is lifted; rows run against the tiered namespace
- zipf self-check: top-1% share measured 72.22% vs analytic 71.87% (θ=0.99, n=20971520, 2000000 draws)
- loader: skipped (--skip-fill — an earlier leg of this campaign filled)
- saturation (ycsb-a-zipfian): GENERATOR-LIMITED at 8 conns (+50% moved ops/s +39.5%) — absolutes understate the server; deltas remain valid at fixed generator config
- hot-set gate rows (ycsb:hot_set_*): PENDING the reference leg — run `inf-bench ycsb --dataset-multiple 1` in the same campaign and re-run this leg with `--hot-set-reference <that run's dir or mem-hit.tsv>`; this run publishes its own memory-hit split in `mem-hit.tsv` for that comparison

## write amplification by row

Per namespace, worst first — never a node-wide blend (M4-S16).

| row | write amplification |
|---|---|
| ycsb-a-zipfian | 1.825× worst of 4 namespace(s) · blob: n/a (no blob activity) |
| ycsb-b-zipfian | 1.789× worst of 4 namespace(s) · blob: n/a (no blob activity) |
